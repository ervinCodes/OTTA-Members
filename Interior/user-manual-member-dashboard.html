                <div class="pt-5">Production company executives are assigned the initial hiring rights in OTTA's Employer Portal.
                  They can submit the initial Job Request for as many roles as needed or focus on hiring the
                  Department Head. If they wish to delegate the hiring rights to the Department Head, they can do
                  so. This delegation will appear in the Department Head's Member Dashboard.</div>
